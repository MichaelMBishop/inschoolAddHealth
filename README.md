**Data Source:** inschool.xpt - Wave 1, In-School Survey, Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health

**Purpose:** Provide the fastest best way to understand and begin analyzing this data
             Original variables are recoded such that
             1) most are given more meaningful variable names
             2) all missing codes become system missing
             3) many vars are given labels
             4) most categorical variables are encoded as class "factor" with labelled responses
         
      
**Notes:**

Change the location of the data indicated in the first few lines of code.Then, if you already have the listed packages installed, the remainder of the code may be executed at once.

Inevitably, one must make some arbitrary choices, (e.g. see coding of race and ethnicity)
I've tried to make everything as transparent as possible, but please see
the in school codebook to be certain you understand the data.
